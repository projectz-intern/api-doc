#Responses as warnings for mistakes while using Postman

Welcome to the OCRANE Enterprise API documentation. The OCRANE Enterprise
API allows a client to upload receipt documents and view the raw results in
the form of a structured data set.

Sample code is available for reference in Java, and Python on the right. The
Java code requires the Unirest library. The Python code requires the Unirest
and Json libraries.

To integrate the OCRANE Enterprise API with your application, check out the
[Getting Started] section for a step-by-step guide and workflow overview.
